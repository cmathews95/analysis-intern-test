----------Algorithm------------
1) Find users who have cancelled their account & made >= 2 successful purchases.
2) Find avg( max(ts < max(ts)) - ts of cancellation trasaction ) for each user in part 1.

------------Query--------------
*This query selects the user_id's you need to find the average transactions for*
*I had a hard time adding part 2 of the algorithm because of new SQL syntax*

select user_id, max(ts < max(ts)) from transactions where user_id in (
  select user_id from transactions group by user_id having count(*) >= 3) intersect
  select user_id from transactions where transaction_type_id = 4 and transaction_status_id >= 1)
and transaction_status_id >=1 and (transaction_type_id = 4 or transaction_type_id = 3) order by user_id


----------Subqueries------------
// Need to narrow down results to people who have cancelled their account. Only count successful/pending transactions
// You could just count successful transactions but might get more recent/relevant info from counting pending trans.'s
A = select user_id from transactions where transaction_type_id = 4 and transaction_status_id >= 1

// Need to narrow down results to people who have made more than 2 successful/pending purchases
// transaction_type_id = 3 and transaction_status_id >= 1
B = select user_id from A where user appears at-least 3 times in transactions
